It also seeks to highlight Girish’s genius and creativity to counter the desire that some people have to focus on his bohemian side — his carefree, wanton life, and his addiction to drugs and alcohol. In fact, some Westerners have half-seriously told me that Girish is their role model. </SPAN

>In those days the city of Calcutta was the seat of British rule in India and the main port of entry for the ideas and culture of the West. The changes that were taking place in India, for the worse and for the better, all had their beginnings there. In making the journey from Kamarpukur to Calcutta, Gadadhar [Ramakrishna] had passed from the timelessness of village life into the very midst of contemporary history....The British had been peacefully established for more than seventy years.

They were builders of bridges, roads, hospitals, and schools—public benefactors who were nevertheless ceaselessly engaged in the piecemeal conquest of a nation. For the Indians, who did not want them, they sacrificed their health and their lives, going back to England prematurely aged, yellow-faced, on crutches, to die. Tens of thousands of them were buried in the country during the two centuries of their occupation. Many were altruistic, many were heroic, many were deeply devout and felt that they had accepted voluntary exile in this savage and unhealthy land in order to do God’s work among the benighted.

He’s putting on airs.” You see, he was a very good tester in one way, because like all actors, he deeply suspected all kinds of behaviour at its surface level. He always looked to see what was underneath it —what it was all about. And I think that actors come to feel more and more, as they play different roles, a sort of instinctive sense of unreality at the surface of the personality of different people. They always think, “Well, that’s all very well, but one can switch at any moment. What does it mean? What guarantee is there that this man is on the level?” </SPAN

This time he was much more favourably impressed, very largely because Ramakrishna, instead of sitting in utter meditative grandeur and ignoring everybody and expecting to be bowed to, was the very reverse. Every time he met anybody, he bowed down to them. This delighted Girish because it was out of character. It was out of the conventional role of the holy man. Of course, in India one could easily see so-called holy men in very large numbers which added to Girish’s scepticism. </SPAN

>Only a few days after this, on 21 September 1884, Ramakrishna and some of the devotees visited the Star Theatre, to see a play by Girish about the life of Chaitanya. Girish himself was strolling in the outer compound of the theatre when a member of Ramakrishna’s party came to him and said: “The Master has come to see your play. If you’ll give him a free pass, that will be very kind; otherwise we’ll buy him a ticket.” Girish answered that Ramakrishna need not pay for his seat, but that the others would have to. He then went to greet Ramakrishna in person. But, before he could bow to Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna bowed to him. Every time Girish bowed, Ramakrishna bowed; until Girish, fearing that this might continue all evening, bowed mentally instead of physically and led them all upstairs to a box. He then went home, as he was not feeling well. Thus Girish missed hearing Ramakrishna’s delighted comments on the play and witnessing his frequent periods of ecstasy. When Ramakrishna was asked later how he had liked it, he answered, “I found the representation the same as the reality.”</SPAN

Girish was always longing to find a guru, although, as we have seen, he obstinately refused to believe that any human being could stand in that relation to another. “What is a guru?” he now asked. And Ramakrishna answered: “He’s like a procurer. A procurer arranges for the union of the lover with his mistress. In the same way, a guru arranges the meeting between the individual soul and his beloved, the Divine Spirit.” Then he added: “You need not worry. Your guru has already been chosen.”</SPAN

I just wrote the play to make money.” Ramakrishna just ignored this. Then later on he said to him: “You know, whatever you say, you do know something. There is something in you that recognizes the God-like. It is only if you can recognize the God-like that you can write about the God-like.” And Girish was saying: “Oh, you know, after all it’s nothing. I think I should give it up; it’s silly, all this scribbling.” And Ramakrishna said: “No, absolutely not. You should go on writing. That should be your work.

He was very fond of having tremendous moments of longing for Ramakrishna when he happened to be visiting with his various girlfriends and so on and would rush out to get a carriage, saying he had to see Ramakrishna. He arrived. Nothing could be more tiresome than arriving in the middle of the night, and this is so characteristic of Ramakrishna that he welcomed him completely and they began to dance. Now, I think there is a great significance in their dancing and the idea, again and again we hear of it, of how Ramakrishna stopped drunkards in the road—perfect strangers—and how he got out of the carriage and danced with them. And I think this takes us in a way to a sort of insight into the nature of so-called sin. What Ramakrishna profoundly understood was that all of our so-called vices are in fact frus</SPAN

You’re frightened, you feel menaced, you have enemies, so if you’re in a position to, you give the order to have a million people killed. Or again, on a smaller scale, you want to shut out reality because it is threatening or alarming. You long for some other kind of truth, you long for some kind of transcendental thing, and you proceed to take some form of drug or other —not to be wicked, not to be vicious; but because you want to find a release. You want to find an inner truth, a higher truth through the medium of this. </SPAN

>Of course nowadays we are much more sophisticated about things like this, and people do understand this to a greater extent. But you see, that was why Ramakrishna, looking at a drunkard dancing, could think: “Why, that’s the same as ecstasy, only he’s going about it in the wrong way. The drive behind it, the desire, is for a state of joy in the eternal.” And therefore Ramakrishna felt a tremendous kinship with people who were in this condition. </SPAN

Not here.” And Ramakrishna said: “Go on! Make the most of it while you want to. You’ll give it up one of these days.” And he drank right in front of Ramakrishna. He had broken down the conventional puritanism, the outside layer; he had broken down the standards of mere respectability and its opposite, which we impose on everything. </SPAN

Once Raimani saved a ripe jackfruit for the offering but one of her children —probably Girish —ate part of the fruit. During her devotions she noticed that someone had already eaten some of the fruit, so she did not offer it to the Lord. (According to the Hindu custom, food defiled in that manner cannot be offered to the deity.) That night she dreamt that a beautiful young child with a blue complexion said to her with a smile: “I love jackfruit. Why did you not offer it to me? It does not matter that it is defiled; I also dwell in your children. Tomorrow, offer that remaining piece of jackfruit to me.”</SPAN

But Akrura paid them no heed. He took Krishna away from Vrindaban, and thus the days of joy that Krishna’s playmates had known in his company came to an end. Girish listened to the story intently, with tears in his eyes. He then asked, “Did Krishna ever return to Vrindaban?” “No,” replied his grandmother.

Navin Chandra Sarkar, Girish’s first father-in-law, learned bookkeeping from Nilkamal and became an accountant for the Atkinson Tilton Company. When Girish was twenty years old, Navin Chandra decided to train Girish to be a bookkeeper so that he could support his family. Accordingly, he gave him a job at the office where he worked. Girish worked there for nearly eight years and became a favourite of Mr. Atkinson. </SPAN

>Girish recalled: “I was then working at Mr. Atkinson’s office. His company had an indigo business. One day the workers spread indigo on the roof of the warehouse to dry. That night I noticed heavy clouds and signs of imminent rain. There would be a tremendous loss of money if the indigo got soaked, so I hired a carriage and rushed back to the office. I then gathered some porters with the help of the office guards and paid them double wages to carry the entire batch of indigo into the warehouse. Mr. Atkinson was greatly relieved when he heard what I had done. However, when I submitted the bill for the labourers, Mr. Bancroft, his partner, was not happy. He thought that I was overcharging the company. But Mr. Atkinson appreciated my action and supported me. He told me to take three handfuls of money from the safe as a reward. Mr. Bancroft remained silent.”</SPAN

One day while he was there he went for a walk with some friends and, in a boisterous mood, jumped into a deep ravine. When he tried to climb out he found he was unable to do so. His friends then attempted to rescue him, but they failed. One of them commented: “Now we are in </SPAN

Let us all pray together.” Girish found himself joining wholeheartedly in the prayer, and strangely, just then he found a way out of the ravine. After he was safe he said to his friends: “Today I have called on God out of fear. If I ever call on Him again, it will be out of love; otherwise I will not call on Him, even at the cost of my life.”</SPAN

Helpless, he went to a friend and asked for a loan of ten rupees. His friend replied: “I shall not loan you ten rupees, but I shall give you five.” Girish accepted the money with tears, as his pride was very much wounded. When that friend came to Calcutta, Girish went to him to repay the money. The friend said that he had given him the money and did not expect it to be repaid.

He worked there for a year, and then joined the Parker Company as an accountant. At one point Mr. Parker introduced a calling bell in his office. One day he rang for Girish. Girish heard the bell but did not respond. Mr. Parker sent an attendant to ask Girish whether he had heard the bell. Girish simply replied, “No, I didn’t hear the bell,” and continued with his work. The attendant’s report angered Mr. Parker, and he went to Girish himself. “I was calling you. Why didn’t you respond?” he asked. “I did not hear the bell,” answered Girish. “And even if I did, how would I know that the bell was calling me? The bell never said, ‘Girish, Girish.’” Becoming serious, he said: “Listen, sir. So far I have spoken to you as a gentleman; now I shall be frank. I am not your servant or bearer.

Girish was made for his role as theatre manager, playwright, director, and actor. He was not born to be an accountant and lead an ordinary life. Jahuri recognized Girish’s talent and gave him complete freedom, believing that by doing so his theatre would flourish. Girish immediately brought in the actors and actresses whom he had already worked with, as well as some new performers, and formed a strong and stable group. He sought out good plays for the stage and began by selecting </SPAN

>(Thirty Years Onstage): “The Bengali theatres were dependent on playwrights who could not supply enough plays to meet the demand. As a result the theatres could not stand firmly on their own feet. The theatres survived by using a few plays of Dinabandhu and sometimes transforming Bankim Chandra’s novels into plays. Just as during a fam</SPAN

From the time he appeared, people realized that a theatre cannot thrive only on good acting; it also needs well-written plays. Good plays are the main food and life force of a theatre. Girish was behind several theatres in Bengal and saved them by feeding the audi</SPAN

Because of this, Girish became known as the ‘Father of the Native Stage’, and not its uncle. The stage had been running as if it had no guardian; it was shaky and near collapse. The immortal nectar that has kept the Bengali stage alive for the last fifty years was actually brought by Girish. So he alone should be glorified as the Father of the Bengali Stage.”</SPAN

>Girish based most of his dramas on stories from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas, or the lives of the saints, historical events, or social issues. He tried to use the characters in his plays to inspire his audience with higher ideals. Girish said: “A playwright must be inspired by his national sentiment before writing a drama. He should deeply imprint in his mind the national character and environment; national actors and actresses; national religious, social, and political conditions; and the current national sentiment of the people. The Hindus from their childhood know the characters of Rama, Krishna, Bhishma, Arjuna, Bhima, and so on, and they appreciate the high ideals of those heroes. As a heroic character is cherished by a bellicose heroic nation, so a patient, self-sacrificing, religious character occupies the Hindu heart. The hearts of Hindus are saturated with religious sentiments, so one should write plays based on religion. Foreigners invaded India by the sword but could not destroy the religious sentiments in their hearts.”</SPAN

Dandi knew that it was impossible to defeat Krishna, so he took refuge in Krishna’s sister Subhadra, who was married to Arjuna. She and the Pandavas gave shelter to Dandi and thus a war became inevitable between Krishna and his cousins the Pandavas. The Pandavas gave shelter to Dandi, so it was their dharma to protect him.

Where shall I put my feet?’ And the next moment, seeing his burning house, he would cry out: ‘My wife Manorama is at home! Let me go!

They protested in front of the Classic Theatre, and the play closed on the fourth night. It was not only a setback for Girish, but a death blow to the memory of an important event in Indian history.

The owners of the Minerva Theatre came to Girish and requested him to write a drama on that subject. Although Girish was in favour of widow marriage, he did not express his personal opinion in the play. Rather, he gave all arguments in favour and against this social custom and left the decision to the audience. He called his play: </SPAN

>It is hard for a genius to be confined within a limited circle of ideas, so Girish continually explored new themes for his plays. He had already written many social, religious, and historical dramas. Now he decided to write a drama based on Vedanta, in which he would focus on the life of Shankaracharya, an eighth-century philosopher. Swami Brahmananda encouraged him, and Girish took this as an order from the guru, because the scriptures say, “The son of a guru is regarded as the guru.” Girish could not direct the drama because he was unwell and was living in Varanasi. His son, Surendra, performed in the title role, but he went to Varanasi first to rehearse the role with his father. </SPAN

But it was an easy task comparatively, for Sri Gauranga’s creed of love is in itself a fascinating subject, and treated by his masterly pen, it was destined to crown him with success. The creed of Shankaracharya is the creed of knowledge, which is proverbially dry. A student of Hindu Philosophy can hardly guess how Shankara’s life and doctrine can form the subject-matter of a dramatic performance, especially in these times when levity on the stage is the order of the day. But our Girish Chandra has performed an apparently impossible task by infusing into the dry loves of the subject, balmy liveliness which has made the drama quite agreeable to every variety of taste. The play, in short, is an all-round masterpiece which adds a fresh laurel to the already overloaded brow of the dramatist.</SPAN

He was also vehemently attacked by puritans for engaging courtesans for women’s roles in his dramas. Before this, men had generally performed in women’s roles. Often the women Girish chose proved to be dedicated and talented actresses. They were poorly educated, but Girish trained them and wrote his dramas in simple language so that they could portray the characters with naturalness. The famous actress Tinkari said: “I was an illiterate girl. It was by his [Girish’s] grace that I am now an actress.”</SPAN

He said: “While acting, an actor divides his mind and focusses it in two ways: With one half of his mind he remains absorbed in his own role, and with the other half he becomes a witness. At that time he watches how he is absorbed in his role, the delivery of his speech, the reaction and dialogue of his co-actors, and whether his voice is reaching the last row of the theatre.

>Girish was not only the founding father of the Bengali stage, but also a luminous star. The English are proud of Shakespeare; the Germans of Goethe; the French of Moliere; so the Bengalis are proud of Girish. In fact, such a versatile genius like him is extremely rare in the world: He was a talented playwright and poet, a thrilling actor, a wonderful composer of songs, a storyteller, an outstanding director and educator, an original thinker and philosopher, a great devotee, and a lover of the fallen and downtrodden in society. If Girish’s works were to be translated from Bengali into English, people the world over would appreciate and benefit from this great nineteenth-century genius. During his lifetime, Girish was compared to David Garrick of England, an actor and playwright. King George III of England was Garrick’s patron, but Girish relied only on his creative faculty, his charismatic personality, his indomitable energy, and the grace of his guru. </SPAN

>t is said that atheists keep religion alive because atheists think of God more often than so-called believers. Most of the time true atheists believe that God does not exist. Thus they think of God in a negative way. Napoleon said, “A man cannot become an atheist merely by wishing it.” Francis Bacon wrote, “Atheism is rather in the lip than in the heart of man.” This was true in Girish’s life. His large ego and exuberant energy drove him to refuse God, challenge His existence, fight against His will, and ridicule His devotees. Girish was a born actor, and playing the role of an atheist forced him to think of God most of the time. </SPAN

In 1867, when Kalinath was a railway police officer in Raniganj, Girish visited him and stayed at his house. Girish was then 23 years old.

>When we were students, because of the influence of English education, some became materialists, some Christians, some Brahmos. Seldom did we find anyone who had any faith in Hinduism. Among the Hindus also, there were many sects, such as Shakta, Vaishnava, and so on. Again, there were many sects among the Vaishnavas. Each sect was so intolerant of the other that they would pray for each other to go to hell. Moreover, the brahmin priests were degenerate: they used the wrong scripture to perform a shraddha ceremony. I have seen a priest go to answer the call of nature, then take the impure water from the jug with his finger, rub it on the mud wall, put a mark on his forehead, and then go to perform worship. Observing all these things, I lost faith in my religion. </SPAN

>Again, I read English literature and found that the materialists are the greatest in learning and intelligence. Thus I would consider disbelief in God to be a sign of erudition. But the idea of God is deeply rooted in Indian life, so it is not easy to eradicate God from a Hindu’s heart. Sometimes I would argue with my educated friends about the existence of God. Occasionally I visited the Brahmo Samaj, but I remained in the same darkness. I couldn’t understand anything. Does God exist? If so, which religion should I follow? Mentally I prayed: “Lord, if you do exist, please show me the way.” Gradually I realized that everything is false. If water, air, and light are freely available in our ephemeral life, then why should one search for religion, which is indispensable to eternal life? Materialists are learned and wise and whatever they say is true.</SPAN

>Our family was a very traditional one. We believed in God when we were children, and worship was incorporated into our play. During my youth I was greatly influenced by Keshab Chandra Sen and joined his Brahmo Samaj, which taught me to discard image worship as idolatry. When I joined the public theatre as an actor, I didn’t feel any necessity to call on God. Gradually I lagged far away from the door of God and remained in darkness. Thus the days passed by. One day Girish and I left on foot for the theatre on Beadon Street. On the way we came to the Siddheswari Kali Temple at Baghbazar. Girish bowed down to the Divine Mother, but I just stood there. When we began to walk again, Girish asked me, “Didn’t you bow down?” “No,” I replied. Girish did not say anything. Then we reached Shobhabazar, Girish bowed down to the Lord Panchananda, and I turned my face in another direction. When we resumed our journey, Girish asked, “Why did you turn away?” I replied, “That deity is inauspicious.” Girish: “Do you firmly believe that that is true?” I replied: “Everyone says that, so I believe it.” Girish: “Very well! Hold onto that faith. Never look at the face of that deity.” </SPAN

Every other day, his temperature would rise at noon. I told this to Brother Girish. He gave me a grain of sago and said: ‘You give this sago to Upen. Tell him that Brother Girish has given him this medicine and he will definitely be cured.’ Accordingly I gave that sago to Upen on the day he would normally have had a fever. At noon Upen’s eyes turned a little red and his forehead became warm. I told him: ‘You won’t get a fever today.’ Upen soon began to perspire and his feverishness disap</SPAN

>Surendra Nath Ghosh, Girish’s son, told this story: “When I was a boy I had a pet bird and I would feed it regularly. One day I returned from school to find that the bird was dying. I began to cry. My father was then eating lunch. He asked, ‘What happened?’ I replied: ‘Perhaps my bird was bitten by a poisonous worm. It may die.’ My father was eating a mango. He took a mango peel and asked me to feed it to the bird. I said: ‘The bird is dying. How will it eat?’ He said emphatically, ‘You just obey me.’ I took the peel and put it near the bird’s beak. Meanwhile my tutor arrived and I went to finish my homework. When the teacher left, I rushed to the bird and found it was all right and hopping around inside its cage.”</SPAN

>The curtain finally fell on Girish’s doubts about God when he had the following vision. One night after a performance in the theatre, Girish was praying to the Divine Mother in a dark and solitary place. He felt that the room was filled with a divine effulgence and Someone was saying to him: “Girish, you wanted to see Me, so I have come. Look, you can see Me only by giving up all your hopes and desires, and driving the joys and pleasures of the world from your heart entirely. After seeing Me, a person never returns to the world [meaning that he merges into Cosmic Consciousness].” </SPAN

Please ask for whatever you want.’ When I was trying to imagine all the enjoyable objects of the world, my conscience revealed the horrible results of those things in my heart, which was stricken with fear of death. Frightened, I said, ‘Mother, I don’t want any boon.’ I heard again the steady resonant voice: ‘My visit always bears results. If you don’t want any boon, why then did you call Me? Now take my curse: My open sword must fall on something. Tell me, which aspect of yours shall I destroy?’ I was terrified.

The sage Narada suggested to the demon king that if he wanted to find Vishnu, he should torture His devotees ruthlessly and then Vishnu would appear to protect them. Hiranyakashipu agreed to this suggestion. </SPAN

>Hiranyakashipu’s son, Prahlada, was a great devotee of Vishnu and he constantly chanted Vishnu’s name. This angered the king, and he engaged two teachers to convince Prahlada to renounce Vishnu. When this failed, he began to torture his own son. He ordered his soldiers to attack Prahlada, but they could not kill him. He had his son thrown under the feet of a mad elephant, but the boy was unhurt. Then he had Prahlada put into a blazing fire, but he was not burnt. Finally, the king ordered his men to tie Prahlada to a big rock and throw him into the ocean from a high peak. But Vishnu rescued the boy and carried him to shore. Enraged, the king questioned his son, “Tell me, where is your Vishnu?” </SPAN

>ized that he had a mission to save humanity from worldly bondage, and that if he wanted to fulfill his goal, he would have to renounce his home, his mother, and his wife. He had a school in his hometown of Navadwip, but he resolved to become a teacher of the world. Thus one night he left home and went to the monastery of Keshav Bharati at Kalna, on the other side of the Ganges, where he took monastic vows and became Sri Krishna Chaitanya. After that, he was on his way to Vrindaban, the playground of Krishna, when his disciples learned that he had become a monk. They then brought him back to Shantipur to meet with his mother, and she gave him permission to live at Puri, the abode of Lord Jagannath on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. His wife, Vishnupriya, chose to lead the life of a nun. For almost twenty-four years, Chaitanya lived in Puri, where he met great men such as Raja Prataprudra, who became his devotee, and Pandit Basudeva Sarvabhauma, who had a vision of Chaitanya as Rama and Krishna, and then realized that he was an incarnation of God. </SPAN

While he was teaching them, a group that included teachers of Jewish law and Pharisees brought in a woman who had been caught committing adultery. They said to Jesus: “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. In our Law, Moses commanded that such a woman must be stoned to death. Now, what do you say?” They said this to trap Jesus. Jesus kept quiet at first, but when they repeated the question, he replied, “Whichever one of you who has committed no sin may throw the first stone at her.” When they heard this, they all left, one by one. Only Jesus remained with the woman. He then asked her: “Where are they? Is there no one left to condemn you?” </SPAN

No one was deprived of his teaching—be that person a sadhu or a yogi, a sinner or a fallen woman. Incognito, he appeared as a poor and humble human being and mixed with all equally, out of pure love and compassion. The holy feet of this divine being—the saviour of the fallen—touched the national theatre of Bengal. Ordinary people despised the theatre, considering it to be an abode of immoral men and women, but heaven and hell were equal in the eyes of that great deliverer of sinners. So Ramakrishna—the teacher of humankind, the man-god, the compassionate one—came to the theatre. The touch of his holy feet sanctified the stage by wiping out all impurities, enhanced its dignity and beauty, and made it an attractive and wonderful place.</SPAN

Her mother and grandmother were very poor, but her grandmother had a small house and a few cottages that they rented out. This was their main source of income—but it was meagre, because the cottages were in a slum and their tenants payed only nominal rent. Binodini and her younger brother both grew up without a father and the small family struggled against poverty. The income they received was not sufficient, so the women of the family were forced to sell their jewellery for food, clothing, and other necessities. When Binodini was 6 years old, her grandmother arranged for her 5-year-old brother to marry a 2 1/2-year-old orphan girl. This mar</SPAN

At the end of the play, the actress had the good fortune to take the dust of the Master’s feet when he was in ecstasy. From then on she considered the Master to be a living god. She cherished a heartfelt love and respect for him, and she was now looking for an opportunity to see him once more. When she heard of the Master’s fatal disease, she was extremely eager to see him. As she knew Kalipada Ghosh, she fervently requested him to help her visit the Master. </SPAN

He did not believe that the Master’s illness would grow worse if a repentant sinner touched his holy feet. He therefore felt no fear and did not hesitate to take the actress to the Master. One evening he secretly advised her to dress like a gentleman, with hat and coat, and took her to the Shyampukur house. He introduced her to us as his friend, took her to the Master, and told him who she really was. We were not then in the Master’s room, so they faced no obstacles. When the fun-loving Master learned that the actress had dressed like that to hoodwink us, he laughed heartily. He was pleased by her faith and devotion and praised her courage and cunning. He advised her to cultivate faith in and reliance on God, gave her a few spiritual instruc</SPAN

She sent her attendant to invite the minstrel and the little boy to her house, and then asked the man to sing that song again. Seeing that little boy’s jubilant and lively dancing, she shed tears of relief for having recovered from that long illness. She gave two rupees to the singer.

He tells the jailor to inform the Nawab that he had been taken to the Ganges to bathe, and he jumped into it and was drowned. The Muslim jailor took the money, released Sanatan, and helped him to cross the Ganges along with his servant Ishan. Girish’s conscience did not approve of this deceit from a devout Vaishnava like Sanatan, so he created the characters of Ramdin, Alaka, and Nasir and released Sanatan from the dungeon in a more dignified way. </SPAN

They advise him that there is time for everything, and that he should attend to spiritual life after finishing his life in the world and discharging his duties to the world in a proper manner. If the boy does not listen to their advice, they may not say in so many words that their son has gone astray, but will not refrain from saying to friends and relations with a sigh of regret that he is useless and lacking in purpose. There is selfishness in the love of parents. It is seen that the father is partial to an accomplished son. As long as the son is a mere boy and helpless, the parents are unselfish. But most parents expect that in their old age they will be looked after and provided for by their sons. Greater is the love of the mother for the son who has no talents. Father’s love or mother’s love is very high indeed. But it cannot be said that it is absolutely free from selfishness. </SPAN

If I had attained that condition in which Sri Ramakrishna lived, the condition of being totally free from maya, and if I had had a disciple, I could then have gained the power of understanding Sri Ramakrishna’s love in a small measure. But I don’t know whether I would have been able to express it. I have grasped to some extent the love of Sri Ramakrishna by listening to the stories which other disciples have narrated to me and by comparing notes which I myself have gathered, but it is not possible to describe the story of the pilgrimage of the soul which a fellow traveller has made and to paint a picture of the longings and aspirations of his heart.

I learned from them one big lesson, that there is no way to hide a wicked deed. There is a saying, “Murder will out.” Too true, as I learned. But the deeds had already begun to bear fruit. A terrible future was painted in vivid colours on the canvas of my mind. It was not the end but only the beginning of the episode that darkened my destiny. Punishment had begun, but the way to its escape had not yet been found. Friendless, and surrounded on all sides by enemies who took advantage of my misdeeds to ruin me, I felt that I was adrift on a sea of despair. </SPAN

As the sun removes the darkness of the night, so the sun of hope arose and dispelled the gloom that had gathered thick in my mind. In the sea of trouble I found the harbour of repose. But I had nurtured doubt all these years. I had argued long, saying, “There is no God.” Where would the impressions of these thoughts go? I began to reason in terms of cause and effect and argued that such and such a cause had produced such and such an effect, which was instrumental in bringing release from this danger. It is said that doubt dies hard. Again I fell victim to doubt. But I had not the courage to say boldly, “God does not exist.” </SPAN

I too had an invitation, so I went. After arriving there I found Sri Ramakrishna had already come. A dancing girl was seated by his side in order to sing a few devotional songs for him. Quite a large gathering had assembled in Balaram’s drawing room. Suddenly my eyes were opened to a new vision by Sri Ramakrishna’s conduct. I used to think that those who consider themselves paramahamsas or yogis do not speak with anybody. They do not salute anybody. If strongly urged, they allow others to serve them. But the behaviour of this paramahamsa was quite different. With the utmost humility he was showing respect to everybody by bowing his head on the ground. An old friend of mine, pointing at him, said sarcastically: “Bidhu </SPAN

Some of them accepted the creed of the Brahmo Samaj, but few of them had any respect for Hinduism. Orthodox Hindus were bitterly torn by sectarianism. Conflict between Shaktas and Vaishnavas was very strong. And Vaishnavism too was divided into many sects, each contending for supremacy over the other. Rivalry was growing fast between one sect and another. Moreover, there were other faiths prevalent at the time. Each faith condemned the followers of the other faiths to the darkness of hell. Added to this, many brahmin priests were degenerate. They were completely ignorant of their own scriptures and were not even familiar with the formalities of reli</SPAN

All of a sudden Sri Ramakrishna lost outer consciousness and went into ecstasy, and in that mood he started talking with a young devotee. Many years earlier I had heard some slandering remarks against him, made by a very wicked man. Suddenly I remembered those words, and at that moment Sri Ramakrishna’s ecstasy broke and his mood changed. Pointing towards me, he said, “There is some crookedness in your heart.” I thought: “Yes, indeed. Plenty of it —of various kinds.” But I was at a loss to understand which kind he was particularly referring to. I asked, “How shall I get rid of it?” Sri Ramakrishna replied, “Have faith!” </SPAN

>Time rolled on. One afternoon I went to the theatre and saw on my desk a slip of paper with a note that Sri Ramakrishna would be going to Ram Chandra Datta’s house at Madhu Roy’s Lane, Calcutta. After reading that note I felt in my heart the same kind of strong urge to go to meet him as I had felt on that day when I saw the Master coming while I was sitting on the porch of a friend’s house in our neighbourhood. I was very eager to go. But again I considered, “Should I go to a stranger’s house without an invitation?” But the pull of the invisible string was strong. I had to go. I went as far as Anath Babu’s market and stopped. Then I thought again, “No, I must not go.” But I was helplessly drawn. I would go a few steps and then stop. I hesitated even after coming very near to the house of Ram Chandra. </SPAN

I repeated it once more, and he said the same thing. But Manomohan Mitra, an ardent devotee of his, said to me rudely: “Enough. He has already answered you. Why do you bother him again?” I turned towards him to answer sharply, for no one who criticized me ever escaped the lash of my tongue. But I controlled myself, thinking: “Manomohan must be right.

>One night, in a happy and drunken mood, I was visiting a house of prostitution with two of my friends. But suddenly I felt an urge to visit Sri Ramakrishna. My friends and I hired a carriage and drove out to Dakshineswar. It was late at night, and everyone was asleep. The three of us entered Sri Ramakrishna’s room, tipsy and reeling. Sri Ramakrishna grasped both my hands and began to sing and dance in ecstasy. The thought flashed through my mind: “Here is a man whose love embraces all—even a wicked man like me, whose own family would condemn me in this state. Surely this holy man, respected by the righteous, is also the saviour of the fallen.” </SPAN

I must take shelter at his feet, for he alone can bring me peace.” </SPAN

I prostrated myself before Sri Ramakrishna and mentally recited the verse “The guru is Brahma, the guru is Vishnu, the guru is the Lord Maheshwara, the god of gods.” He said: “I was just talking about you. And if you don’t believe me, ask Bhavanath!” </SPAN

>After a while he started to give me some spiritual advice. I stopped him, saying: “I won’t listen to any advice. I have written cartloads of it myself. It doesn’t help. Do something that will transform my life.” Hearing these words, Sri Ramakrishna was highly pleased. Ramlal, his nephew, was present. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to recite a particular hymn, which ran thus: “Go into solitude and shut yourself in a cave. Peace is not there. Peace is where faith is, for faith is the root of all.” I saw a smile playing on the lips of Sri Ramakrishna, and I felt at that moment that I was freed from all impurities. And at that moment my arrogant head bowed low at his feet. In him I found my sanctuary and all my fear was gone. I prostrated myself before him and was about to return home. He followed me as far as the northern porch. There I asked him, “Now that I have received your grace, am I to continue the same kind of work that I have been doing?” Sri Ramakrishna replied, “Yes, why not?” From his words I understood that my connection with the theatre would not hurt my spiritual life. </SPAN

I felt I was a child of the mother and the mother was feeding me. But now when I remember how these lips of mine had touched many impure lips, and how Sri Ramakrishna fed me, touching them with his holy hand, I am overwhelmed with emotion and say to myself: “Did this actually happen? </SPAN

By touching the horns, legs, or tail of a cow, we in fact touch the cow herself; but for us the essential thing about a cow is her milk, which comes through the udder.

Neither did he understand completely, nor did he have the power to foresee, that no matter what came into his life —good or bad, praise or blame, joy or suffering—he would be able to do nothing but silently bear it. All other thoughts disappeared from his mind, and he felt only the infinite grace of Sri Ramakrishna. And his ego swelled a hundredfold because of this </SPAN

Knowing of Girish’s new attitude of self-surrender, the Master began to train him with this in mind. One day while in the Master’s presence, Girish said “I shall do this,” regarding a trifling matter. Immediately the Master said: “What is this? You must not talk in that dogmatic way. Suppose you fail to do it! Say ‘I shall do this if God wills.’” Girish understood: “That’s right. When I have given all of my responsibilities to God and He has accepted them, I shall be able to do that work if He thinks that I should and that it is good for me.” Henceforward, he began to shun the idea of ego and such expressions as “I shall do,” “I shall go,” and so on. </SPAN

Did you make an empty promise when you gave him the power of attorney and transferred your responsibility to him?” Thus as time passed Girish began to understand more and more the hidden meaning of the power of attorney. Did he now comprehend its whole meaning? When asked about this, Girish replied: “There is still much to understand! Did I realize then that there was so much mystery in the power of attorney? Now I see that there is a limit to the time one must spend practising meditation, japa, and austerities, but the work of a person who has given the power of attorney is unending.

<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F"
>Various thoughts arise in our minds in the context of the power of attorney. We find in the religious history of the world that some great teachers like Jesus and Chaitanya sometimes gave assurances of this kind to a few people. Ordinary gurus do not have the ability to accept that responsibility, nor do they have the right to do so. Ordinary teachers or monks can at best instruct others by giving them a mantra or a specific spiritual practice, which can help them to make spiritual progress. Or by leading a pure life, they can inspire others to become more pure. When a person who is entangled in worldly bondage and is completely helpless is instructed to do a certain thing, that person says in despair: “How can I do that? If you give me the power, I can try.” It is beyond the capacity of an ordinary guru to help such a person. It is impossible for one person to say to another, “I am taking on the responsibility for your bad karma, and I shall accept its consequences on your behalf.” When spirituality declines in human hearts, God incarnates out of compassion, suffers on behalf of the people, and redeems them from the whirlpool of maya. Although He does that, He does not completely absolve humanity. He makes individu</SPAN

One day, finding the gate open, a cow entered the garden and began to eat the plants. The brahmin was away on business. When he returned, he saw that the cow was eating his plants. In a rage he attacked the cow with a staff and hit her on a vital spot, killing her instantly. Now the brahmin became afraid: He had just killed a cow, which to a Hindu is the gravest of all sins. The brahmin had studied a little Vedanta, and he had learned that each of the human senses performs its respective functions by means of the power of a particular deity. For example, the eyes see with the power of the sun god, the ears hear with the power of the wind god, the hands work with the power of Indra [the king of gods], and so on. Remembering this, the brahmin thought: “Then I am not the one who killed the cow. My hands move by the power of Indra, so it is Indra who has killed the cow.” Thus firmly convinced, the brahmin was reassured. </SPAN

Who has planted these trees so neatly and artistically?” Listening to this praise of his garden, the brahmin replied joyfully: “Sir, this is my garden. I have planted all these trees. Please come, let me show you around.” He showed Indra his garden in detail and told Him many stories about the plants. Then inadvertently they came to the spot where the dead cow was. Startled, Indra asked: “Oh God! Who has killed this cow?” So far the brahmin had said about his garden, “I have done this; I have done that.” And now when he was asked who had killed the cow, he was terribly embarrassed and kept quiet. Then Indra reassumed His real form and said to the brahmin: “You hypocrite! You have done what is best in the garden, yet it is I who have killed the cow! Is that so? Now accept the sin of your cow killing.” With that Indra disappeared and the sin seized the brahmin’s body.</SPAN

At 4:00 p.m. the father asked his elder son, ‘Where is your brother?’ ‘Perhaps he has gone fishing,’ he replied. The father said: ‘Call him here. The refreshments have arrived. Let us all eat together.’ The elder son went to call his brother, but he replied, ‘Brother, forgive me. I can’t go now. Let me first catch a fish and then I shall come.’ When the father heard this, he angrily said, ‘Wherever that boy goes, he creates problems.’ He went to him, snatched the fishing rod from him, and broke it into pieces. He then took his younger son by the hand and brought him to the cottage. They ate the refreshments, then returned home by carriage. The younger son might have been wayward, but the father did not leave him there.” </SPAN

>On 28 July 1885, Ramakrishna went to the Calcutta home of a wealthy man named Nanda Basu to see his collection of pictures of gods and goddesses. Ramakrishna was greatly impressed and said to Nanda: “Though you are a householder, you have still kept your mind on God. Is that a small thing? The man who has renounced the world will pray to Him as a matter of course. Is there any credit in that? But blessed indeed is he who, while leading a householder’s life, prays to God. He is like a man who finds an object after removing a stone weighing twenty maunds.” * </SPAN

>On this occasion, Nanda Basu served sweets to Ramakrishna and then offered him betel-leaf on a tray. But the other guests had already taken some from that tray, so the Master would not accept any. Nanda noticed this and questioned him about it. Ramakrishna replied: “Before I eat anything, I offer it to God. It is a notion of mine.” It is the custom that something can be offered to God only if no one else has partaken of it beforehand. Nanda was somewhat proud of his knowledge of Vedanta philosophy. Trying to evaluate Ramakrishna’s actions intellectually, he said, “But the betel-leaf would have gone to God all the same.” He said further: “You are a paramahamsa. Why do you abide by the injunctions or prohibitions of the scriptures? They are meant for ignorant people.” Ramakrishna smiled and again remarked, “It is just a notion of mine.”</SPAN

Wanting to test this idea, Girish invited Ramakrishna to his house. Without any comment, Girish brought in a tray of betel-leaf, took one himself, and then offered the tray to the Master. The Master immediately understood Girish’s intent and, with a smile, took a betel-leaf from the tray.

After a few days Girish told the boy, “Pray to the paramahamsa of Dakshineswar and mentally promise to offer him rasagollas after you have recovered.” The servant followed Girish’s instructions.

After he had finished bathing, he went to Girish and said, “Sir, I want to go to Dakshineswar and offer rasagollas to the paramahamsa.” Girish exclaimed: “What happened? I heard that you fell and injured your right arm again.” “It is true, sir,” the servant replied. “But when I got up after my fall, I discovered that my arm was set back in place, and my pain subsided considerably.” Thinking of the Master, Girish bowed down to him again and again and said: “Who says, Master, that you do not answer our prayer?

>In 1885 during the Dashahara Festival, which involves the worship of the Ganges, Ramakrishna asked Girish to bathe in the holy river. Girish was reluctant to do so. It is a common belief that anyone who bathes in the Ganges becomes pure. Girish considered this idea to be mere superstition. The Master finally persuaded him by saying, “If you [being a great devo</SPAN

>tee] do not follow these religious customs, who else will?” Girish obeyed and later he would bathe in the Ganges on auspicious occasions. One day, however, the thought occurred to him that if the Master had taken on his power of attorney, why should he need to bathe in the Ganges to be purified? Again, he wondered why the Master had asked him to do so. His analytical mind soon found an answer: When sinners bathe in the Ganges, the goddess Ganges absorbs their sins and makes them pure. However, when holy people bathe, She gains virtue by offering peace and delight to them. He concluded that through the Master’s grace he had become so pure that the redeeming power of Mother Ganges would increase a hundredfold when he bathed.</SPAN

But when I closed my eyes and thought of the Master, I saw him smiling, his face joyful. Without further thought I descended into the Ganges and said to Her: ‘Mother Ganges, by the grace of the Master I am bathing in Your water to purify You.’ Saying so I dipped my body into the Ganges and got up. I felt a wonderful bliss in my heart. From then on, whenever I bathed in the Ganges, the same thought would arise.”</SPAN

Consequently, a beautiful garden house was found in Cossipore, and the move was made on 11 December 1885. An arrangement was made whereby the Master’s householder disciples would contribute money for his treatment and his food, and to pay the rent. The young unmarried disciples, the nucleus of the future monastic order, would manage the household, including shopping and caring for the Master. After a while some of the householder disciples noticed that expenditures were gradu</SPAN

He began walking slowly through the garden, and some devotees followed him. Suddenly Ramakrishna said to Girish, “Well, Girish, what have you found in me that you proclaim me before all as an Incarnation?” Falling to his knees before the Master and saluting him with folded hands, Girish responded with great emotion: “Who am I to speak of Him?

Please bring some Ganges water and sprinkle it on me.” Ramlal recalled: “He was extremely restless. I asked, ‘What happened?’ He replied: ‘I came into this world secretly with a few close devotees, and now Ram [Ram Chandra Datta] is spreading my name. He brings all sorts of people here and asks me to touch and bless them. How much burden can I carry? I got this disease [cancer] by taking the sins of these people upon myself.

Ramakrishna pointed to his young disciples and said: “Why not give them to these boys? They are full of the spirit of renunciation. You won’t find better monks anywhere.” Gopal had twelve pieces of cloth and twelve rosaries, which he handed over to the Master. Then Ramakrishna himself distributed them among eleven of his young disciples. Thus, the Master himself laid the foundation of the future Ramakrishna Order. One cloth and one rosary were left, and the Master asked that they be kept for Girish; for, indeed, he was second to none in his spirit of renunciation.</SPAN

>ociety, friendship, and love are divine gifts. Close friendship usually develops between contemporaries, but even though Girish was nearly twenty years older than Swami Vivekananda, they behaved as if they were the same age and became close friends. Despite the years that separated them, they had mutual love and respect. Seldom has there been such an open and frank relationship between two great souls. They teased each other, argued and debated various issues. People enjoyed their friendly squabbles and lively conversations. Both men were geniuses and were extremely creative; both were cynics and at the same time lovers of God; both were proud of their physical and intellectual powers; both had struggled and sought a guru. Where self-effort ends, divine grace begins. Providence finally brought them both to Ramakrishna, whose pure love and spiritual power overwhelmed them. Both of these rebellious souls became disciples of Ramakrishna. </SPAN

When the play was over and the audience had left, Girish brought Narendra to the stage and introduced him to the actors and actresses. Inspired by the play, Narendra picked up a tanpura and began to sing devotional songs. Tears trickled from his closed eyes, and his voice was at times choked with devotion. It seemed as if he was visualizing his beloved Lord and calling to Him as he sang. The theatre became a temple that night as a current of devotion flowed. The atmosphere became heavy with spirituality and longing for God. </SPAN

There was a big river between the two villages, and this man, every day, used to go to that girl, crossing this river in a ferry boat. Now, one day he had to perform the obsequies of his father, and so, although he was longing, almost dying to go to the girl, he could not. The ceremonies had to be performed, and all those things had to be undergone; it is absolutely necessary in Hindu society. He was fretting and fuming and all that, but could not help it. At last the ceremony ended, and night came, and with the night, a tremen</SPAN

>There was no ferry boat. The ferrymen were afraid to cross, but he would go; his heart was becoming mad with love for the girl, so he would go. There was a log floating down, and he got that, and with the help of it, crossed the river, and getting to the other side dragged the log up, threw it on the bank, and went to the house. The doors were closed. He knocked at the door, but the wind was howling, and nobody heard him. So he went round the walls and at last found what he thought to be a rope, hanging from the wall. He clutched at it, saying to himself, “Oh, my love has left a rope for me to climb.” By the help of that rope he climbed over the wall, got to the other side, missed his footing, and fell, and the noise aroused the inmates of the house, and the girl came out and found the man there in a faint. She revived him, and noticing that he was smelling very unpleasantly, she said, “What is the matter with you? Why is this stench on your body? How did you come into the house?” </SPAN

How did you cross the river?” “Why, I got hold of a log of wood.” “Let us go and see,” said the girl. The rope was a cobra, a tremendously poisonous serpent, whose least touch is death. It had its head in a hole, and was getting in when the man caught hold of its tail, and he thought it was a rope. The madness of love made him do it. When the serpent has its head in its hole, and its body out, and you catch </SPAN

He got a glimpse of the beyond for a moment. “Is there a God?” “Yes, yes, my friend, there is,” said the woman. And the man walked on, went into a forest, began to weep and pray: “I want Thee, Oh Lord! This tide of my love cannot find a receptacle in little human beings. I want to love where this mighty river of my love can go, the ocean of love; this rushing tremendous river of my love can</SPAN

One day he was sitting on the bank of a river, at one of the bathing places, and a beautiful young girl, the wife of a merchant of the city, with her servant, came and passed the place. The old man was again up in him, the beautiful face again attracted him. The Yogi looked and looked, stood up and followed the girl to her home. Presently the husband came by, and seeing the Sannyasin in the yellow garb he said to him, “Come in, sir, what can I do for you?” The Yogi said, “I will ask you a terrible thing.” “Ask anything, sir, I am a Grihastha (householder), and anything that one asks I am ready to give.” “I want to see your wife.” The man said, “Lord, what is this! Well, I am pure, and my wife is pure, and the Lord is a protection to all. Welcome; come in sir.” </SPAN

He looked and looked, and then said, “Mother, will you give me two pins from your hair?” “Here they are.” He thrust them into his two eyes saying: “Get away, you rascals! Henceforth no fleshy things for you. If you are to see, see the Shepherd of the groves of Vrindaban with the eyes of the soul. Those are all the eyes you have.” So he went back into the forest. There again he wept and wept and wept. It was all that great flow of love in the man that was struggling to get at the truth, and at last he succeeded; he gave his soul, the river of his love, the right direction, and it came to the Shepherd. The story goes that he saw God in the form of Krishna. Then, for once, he was sorry that he had lost his eyes, and that he could only have the internal vision. He wrote some beautiful poems of love. In all Sanskrit books, the writers first of all salute their Gurus. So he saluted that girl as his first guru.</SPAN

He would sit calmly, with closed eyes, in front of Ramakrishna’s portrait. One day he began to cry before the photo of the Master; it was clear that he wanted it. When it was brought down, many ants were found behind the picture. A towel was used to clear away the ants and the child became calm. Soon after this incident, he became seri</SPAN

When the child cried from pain, someone would chant God’s name to calm him, and he would fall asleep. This behaviour convinced Girish that the Master had definitely fulfilled his wish.

With a view to revealing the depth of each other’s wisdom, they would playfully tease or chastise each other. Excited, Girish would burst out: ‘Keep quiet, rascal!

One day their topic of debate was whether God could take a human form. Swamiji baited Girish, attacking his belief in his guru’s divinity: “Look, G.C., whatever you may say, the infinite Brahman cannot enter into a human body, which is only three and a half cubits tall.” Girish responded: “Yes, it is possible. Why not?” Then they began to argue, and neither one would yield. Gradually the argument became louder and louder. The more calmly Swamiji put his counter arguments, the more excited Girish became. Finally Girish slapped the floor and shouted: “You rascal, keep quiet! I have seen the infinite God take finite form in the Master.” Immediately Swamiji got up and embraced him.</SPAN

>In May 1893 Swami Vivekananda left for America to represent Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. He returned to Calcutta almost four years later, in February 1897. When Swamiji arrived he went to Pashupati Basu’s house in North Calcutta, where Girish and other brother disciples received him cordially. Swamiji told Girish: “G.C., I carried your Thakur [Ramakrishna] to the other side of the ocean.” When Girish was about to take the dust of Swamiji’s feet, he said, “What are you doing, G.C.? That would harm me.” He then himself bowed down to Girish.</SPAN

When Swamiji saw Girish in the crowd near the Panchavati, he bowed down to him and said, “G.C., what a difference between those days and these!” Swamiji meant that only a few people had come to pay respect to the Master when he was alive, and now a large number of people attended the festival celebrating the day he was born. Girish replied: “Yes, you are right. But I have a desire to see more of his divine play.” After a short con</SPAN

He said to the devotees: “One day Haramohan [Mitra] told me that he saw in a newspaper that some people had spread a slanderous rumour against Swamiji in America. I said to him: ‘If I see with my own eyes that Naren is doing anything wrong, I will consider that my eyes are defective. I will pull them out. He is the kind of butter that has been collected before sunrise; it never gets mixed with water. Those who see faults in him will go to hell.’” Girish was overwhelmed when Swami Niranjanananda told him about Swamiji’s grand receptions from Colombo to Calcutta on his return to India from the West.</SPAN

She did not and could not then protest, and she humbly suffered all those humiliating remarks in silence, though she knew in her innermost heart that her husband was a god-intoxicated man, far above ordinary people. She then tasted divine bliss whenever she came in contact with him. She did not go to anybody’s house and she never attended any social function lest people should make humiliating remarks about her husband and blame her for her ill luck.

We all followed him.

>One day at Jayrambati Girish had a heated discussion with Kalikumar, one of the Mother’s brothers, regarding whether Holy Mother was an ordinary human being or a goddess. Kalikumar naturally regarded her as his sister and said: “It is you who call her the Divine Mother or the Mother of the Universe. But we were born from the same womb. I do not understand what you say.” “What are you talking about?” replied Girish firmly. “You are the son of an ordinary brahmin, born and reared in a village. You have forgotten the duties of your caste, such as worship and study, and are now living as a farmer. If a man promises you a bullock for your plough, you will run after him for at least six months. Is it not pos</SPAN

What are you saying?” Kalikumar returned to Girish the same person he was before. Girish asked him to go back, but he would not. Girish once remarked that Holy Mother’s broth</SPAN

>Because of the bereavements he had suffered, Girish realized the emptiness of family life. During his visit to Jayrambati he approached Holy Mother for her permission to embrace the monastic life. But the Mother did not give her consent to his request and suggested instead that he continue his literary and acting careers. Girish then gave up the idea of becoming a monk. Shortly after this, Girish took the opportunity to spend a few days in Kamarpukur, and the Mother joined his party. His long association with the Holy Mother and his visits to the sacred places of Jayrambati and Kamarpukur finally brought solace to Girish’s broken heart. He returned to Calcutta and resumed his acting career with fresh vigour and a clearer spiritual outlook. </SPAN

>Girish often visited Holy Mother when she was in Calcutta. Once Holy Mother was returning from a long stay in Jayrambati. Swamis Brahmananda and Premananda went to Howrah Station to receive her. The train was three hours late, but the swamis and her devotees waited. When the train arrived, Yogin-ma and Golap-ma helped Mother out of the train and the swamis rushed to take the dust of her feet. Golap-ma was the Mother’s guard and caretaker. In her high-pitched voice she scolded Swami Brahmananda: “Maharaj, have you no sense whatsoever? The Mother has just gotten off the train, tired and exhausted from the heat. If you make such a fuss about prostrating, how can I restrain the others?” The venerable swamis felt remorseful and stepped back. The Mother was then driven to Udbodhan House in a carriage, and she went upstairs to rest. </SPAN

Girish arrived soon after they did and asked them about Holy Mother. When Golap-ma heard Girish’s voice, she came downstairs and said to him: “My words beat a retreat, Girish Babu, before your grotesque devotion. You have come to see Mother! She is tired and exhausted. She is supposed to have some rest now, but you have come to disturb her.” </SPAN

Girish was upset when he heard this, and he decided to stay in his room while the worship was going on. However, when the time of Sandhi Puja came, Holy Mother changed her mind. She covered herself with a chadar, walked through the narrow lane, and knocked at the back door of Girish’s house, saying: “I have come.” Girish’s maidservant opened the door and news of the Mother’s arrival spread. Girish hurriedly went to the worship hall, bowed down to the Mother, and joyfully remarked: “I thought that my worship of the Divine Mother would be incomplete. Meanwhile the Mother has tapped on the door and announced, ‘Here I have come.’” After four days of worship and Holy Mother’s presence, Girish felt that Mother Durga had graciously accepted his worship. On that auspicious occasion Girish had invited his friends and relatives, as well as the actors and actresses of his theatre, who all received the blessings of the Holy Mother.</SPAN

Dandi leaves his kingdom and runs away with the horse. At last he takes refuge with the Pandavas, who are devoted to Krishna. Bhishma says: “The pole star of this world of maya is dharma, and the essence of dharma is to protect a person who has sought refuge.” A conflict arises between the Pandavas and Krishna that is averted only when the gods and the Divine Mother appear, manifesting all of the eight divine powers. Urvasi is thus freed from the curse and returns to heaven. In this drama, Girish performed the role of Kanchuki, an old brahmin minister in Dandi’s court. </SPAN

If you share this mantra with others, you will go to hell.’ For the benefit of humanity, the great soul Ramanuja disobeys his guru and loudly shouts that mantra to others. Seeing that scene, the Mother went into samadhi. The famous actress Tarasundari acted in the role of Ramanuja. After that scene she came to bow down to the Mother, but found that she had no outer consciousness. After Golap-ma’s repeated calls, the Mother regained partial consciousness. Then Tara bowed down to her. The Mother hugged Tara, considering her to be Ramanuja. When the play was over all of the actresses came and bowed down to the Mother.

Also, I notice that you seem to be even more convinced than I am that the Master is an incarnation of God. This really amazes me. You must perceive something higher about the Master than I do, and for that reason you are trying to attain full realization of whatever that is. Fortunately, after studying mesmerism and hypnotism, I concluded that I did not trust Ramakrishna to give me a strange or supernatural vision, which would put me into an ocean of confusion. If the Master had given me a vision, I would have thought that he had somehow hypnotized me, and thus cheated me. If that had been the case, I am sure it would have been difficult for me to hold onto the faith that the Master is an incarnation of God. I know you want to have spiritual visions. In addition, you believe that the Master is an incarnation of God! Perhaps you are great receptacles, so you can harmonize those contradictory ideas. So I console my mind: “That is not your path. Don’t try to see that supernatural stuff.” But I have such faith that if I have a fancy to attain bhava, a vision, or samadhi, I will forcefully demand those from the Master, and he will immediately impart those to me by his power.</SPAN

>ond wife and his young son died, the monks gave him permission to attend one of their homa ceremonies. He observed the ceremony, and when the monks poured their oblations into the fire, Girish got up and poured his own oblations, imagining that his past samskaras and desires were being burnt. Afterwards, Girish sat silently absorbed in his own thoughts. Suddenly, he became extremely excited and began talking about the Master’s love and compassion. Then his mood changed: He stopped talking and became grave. Without disturbing his mood, the disciples continued to talk about the Master’s divine life. Only one monk noticed that Girish got up and spat on the ashes of the homa altar three times. Girish then came back and began to talk about the Master with doubled enthusiasm. </SPAN

Once I was suffering from asthma and various kinds of ailments. As a result, my body became very weak and I lost faith in Sri Ramakrishna. With a view to getting rid of that dry spell, I engaged pandits to read the Gita and the Chandi to me. But still I had no peace of mind. Some brother disciples came to see me, and I told them about the unhappy state of my mind, but they only kept silent. Then one day Rakhal came and asked me, “How are you?” I replied: “Brother, I am in hell. Can you tell me the way out?” Rakhal listened to me and then burst into laughter. “Why worry about it?” he said. “As the waves of the ocean rise high, then go down again, and again rise, so does the mind. Don’t be upset. Your present mood is due to the fact that it will lead you to a higher realm of spirituality. The wave of the mind is gather</SPAN

>Once Girish asked Swami Vivekananda to write a biography of Ramakrishna. But Swamiji declined, saying that he was incapable of doing this. He said, “Shall I make the image of a monkey while trying to make that of Shiva?” On another occasion Swamiji said, “Sharat will write.” Later, after Swamiji’s passing, Girish asked Saradananda to write about Ramakrishna’s divine life, his sadhana, and his message. He feared that in the future some less knowledgeable people might present the Master in a narrow, incorrect way. This might eventually lead to the creation of a cult, and defeat the purpose of his incarnation. There was cause for such apprehension: It was well known that Girish had given his power of attorney to the Master, who took complete responsibility for him. Later some people started imitating Girish, but they only deceived themselves because they did not understand the importance of self-surrender. </SPAN

She then began to chide God: ‘O unfortunate one, you were waiting to give ears to my words. The moment I asked for fever, you immediately gave it to me. When I pray for so many good things, you put cotton in your ears and do not listen. You only listen to the bad prayers.

>Girish always appreciated the purity and renunciation of the Master’s disciples. He told the following story: “In 1897 Latu went with Swami Vivekananda to visit various places of northern India. When they were in Kashmir, Swamiji hired a houseboat. The boatman and his family used one corner of the boat as their home. But Latu was not prepared for this. He was the first of the party to get onto the boat, but the moment he saw a woman on board, he jumped out again. Swamiji understood the situa</SPAN

What is needed is sincere love for him and absolute surrender to him. Girish had committed many sins, but the Master was impressed by his devotion and so accepted him as his own. That is why Girish used to say at the end of his life, ‘Had I known there was such a huge pit in which to throw one’s sins, I would have committed many more.’ The Master is full of compassion. He is a veritable ocean of mercy.”</SPAN

Go to the Ganges and confess all of your sinful acts to Her while standing in throat-deep water, which will make you sinless. I cannot even sit on a carpet that you have touched.” Girish’s friend did not follow the Master’s advice. One day the Master visited Girish’s theatre. After the performance, the actresses began bowing down to him as he sat in an ecstatic mood, his feet hanging down before him. Girish thought that this would be a great chance for his friend to touch the Master’s feet. But as soon Girish’s friend came close, the Master’s ecstasy broke and he pulled his feet up under his legs. Girish’s plan failed.

It is the nature of the mind to move sometimes up and sometimes down.” Girish said: “Sir, you have the power to make everybody pure and unattached, whether one is a householder or a monk. You are beyond all laws.” What faith he had! The Master said to him: “Yes, it is possible. Exuberant devotion transcends all scriptural injunctions.” Here the Master gave himself away. Who could admit such a thing except an avatar? Whatever Girish asked for from the Master he received. He said to the Master, “Sir, what I was and what I have become—just by thinking of you!” </SPAN

>Years before, when Ramakrishna had introduced Nag Mahashay to Swami Vivekananda, he said: “This man has genuine humility. There is no hypocrisy in it.” Humility was one of the main traits of his character. “I and mine” are the warp and woof of maya, which bind the soul, and </SPAN

Girish once humorously remarked that the great enchantress, Mahamaya, was in trouble when she tried to bind Swami Vivekananda and Nag Mahashay: “As she tried to trap Vivekananda he became bigger and bigger, and at last he became so big that all Her fetters were too short and She had to let him go. And when She attempted to trap Nag Mahashay, he began to make himself smaller and smaller until he had at last reduced himself to such a degree that he could easily slip through the holes of Her net.”<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:6.1pt"

>One day Nag Mahashay was at Girish’s house with other disciples and devotees of Ramakrishna. They were speaking about the Master when Swami Niranjanananda turned to Nag Mahashay and said: “Well, sir, our Master used to say that one who thinks of himself as mean and wretched actually becomes so. Why then do you always think of yourself as so low and degraded?” Nag Mahashay replied: “Ah, I see with my own eyes that I am low and degraded. How can I think that I am Shiva? You can think like that. Girish Babu can say that he is Shiva. You have such great devotion for the Lord. Where is such devotion in me? If you all help me, if the Master grants me his grace, my life will be blessed.” The utter sincerity and humility of his words silenced Niranjanananda. He could neither contradict him nor pursue the subject any further. Girish later said, referring to the incident: “If a man is sincere, and if all idea of egotism has really vanished from his mind, he attains the state of Nag Mahashay. The earth becomes blessed by the very touch of the feet of such great men.”</SPAN

>During his life Girish encountered grief after grief. He tried to find relief from his pain by drinking alcohol, visiting brothels, performing onstage, composing poems, and associating with his guru, Ramakrishna. But the more Girish was tormented by grief, the more his genius became manifest. Once he said: “Without being stricken with grief and pain in life, it is hard to develop the poetic faculty —especially for writing plays. A playwright experiences the truth by undergoing various circumstances. A real poet does not write anything that he has not experienced him</SPAN

>Girish was a man of action. He used to say, “I want work to be done. I don’t want excuses.” He was annoyed with anyone who made excuses for not doing his or her job. Before opening a new drama, he would distribute lists of responsibilities to the cast and crew. If someone suddenly did not show up, or mentioned problems and difficulties and had not followed his guidance, he would say, “Your excuse is wonderful, but remember, the company will still sustain a loss.”</SPAN

As the English novelists are expert in depicting characters, so the French novelists (Dumas, Hugo, and others) are superb in creating stories. But Victor Hugo was endowed equally with a tremendous imagination and a talent for creating characters and stories. If this great novelist had also had a sense of humour, he could have been considered more or less equal to a poet like Shakespeare.”</SPAN

>In 1911 the Mohan Bagan soccer team of Calcutta defeated the British team and won the Indian Football Association shield. This news made Girish so happy and excited that he forgot his old age and illness. When asked why he was so excited, Girish replied: “Previously no one could imagine that in a physical competition the Bengali boys could stand against the British. But today our boys have defeated the English soldiers in soccer. This event will enkindle hope that one day they will be able to defeat the British by physical strength. It is not an easy task. This victory of the I.F.A shield has made the Bengali race advance by ten years.”</SPAN

While talking to people in his parlour, he would suddenly say, ‘Please wait, let me eat something.’ And he would ask his servant Ishan to bring some refreshments. When they were brought, he would immediately begin to eat in front of everybody. After a while he would say, ‘Let me have a little rest.’ Saying this, he would recline on his bolster. After 15 minutes he would sit up and begin to talk again.”</SPAN

Pure thoughts purify the impure mind. The result comes quickly if one strives intensely. A worldly atheist suddenly realized that God exists and that one can find Him by calling on Him sincerely.

The first time I went Swami Saradananda took me. They were close friends and Swami Saradananda paid him daily visits. We turned from the main street into a narrow lane running between high blank walls and closed at the end by Girish Babu’s wide entrance doorway. We passed through this, went along a short hall, across a large court, up an outdoor staircase, over a roof terrace and into a narrow low-studded room on the second storey. There between a window opening on the court and one over the entrance door, on a rug, half reclining against a round bolster, lay the great dramatist like a fallen giant, mighty even in his physical distress. He was a sufferer from asthma and his breath came in quick short gasps. </SPAN

Swami Saradananda left us and Girish Babu plied me with questions about Swami Ramakrishnananda, about Swami Paramananda and his work in the West, about my own religious experiences. Then he began to speak to me of Sri Ramakrishna. I have rarely seen such ardour of discipleship. His face shone with it, his breath grew deep again and one could sense the burning glow in his heart. He told me of their meeting, of the indulgent mother-love the Master had always given him; how in the beginning when he had tried to shock him by a song or word, the Master had merely laughed, as at a wayward child. </SPAN

Towards the close of January some improvement was apparent, but on the full moon day of the next week there was a relapse. The end, however, was evident only in the last two days —not even that, only for the last thirty hours. He himself gave up the struggle twenty-four hours before with the ejaculation: ‘Why still this clinging to matter! Master, remove this intoxication of the flesh.’ A short time after he had spoken these words, he grew quiet, then he went into a state of coma and passed out twelve hours later.”</SPAN

There was an immediate transformation. Faces came out of chadars and I saw their chins for the first time. After this, on arrival and departure, I even got smiles and little acts of courtesy especially from G.C.’s secretary and a Hindu doctor who frequented the house much and was greatly devoted to Girish.

He requested Girish Chandra Ghosh and Sisir Kumar Ghosh to write on “The Vaishnava Religion,” and both agreed. On 6 April 1909, at the suggestion of Sarada, I went to Girish with a request for him to compose a song of harmony for the convention. In the morning when I went to his house, he was not there. I was told that he had gone for a walk on the bank of the Ganges. I went there and found him near the Baghbazar ghat. I noticed him pacing, absorbed in deep thought.

Seeing Girish, the Master said: “My son, you are in a joyful mood! I see that you are in a very happy mood!” Then the Master began to dance, singing: “Haribol! Haribol! Haribol!” [Repeat the name of the Lord.] Girish and his friends were so drunk that they were hardly conscious of anything. At dawn, when Girish became somewhat sober, he found that he and his friends were dancing while holding on to the Master. Sri Ramakrishna was also dancing in a god-intoxicated state, and they were all chanting, “Haribol! Haribol!” and weeping profusely.

If I roll on the ground of the Panchavati at Dakshineswar and forcefully pray to the Master, this disease will go away. But I know the Master is all-merciful. It is his will that I am undergoing this disease, grief, pain, and suffering. Everything is for my good. This feeling, by his grace, is so strong in my mind that I have no inclination to pray that my disease be cured. Sri Ramakrishna is a wish-fulfilling tree. Whenever I have prayed for anything, I have gotten it.”</SPAN

This rite involved setting a horse free, but heavily guarded, to wander around at will for a year. If in that time no one had defeated the soldiers and stolen the horse, all the lands that it had wandered in would belong to the king performing the sacrifice. King Sagara’s sons were guarding the horse, but it got away from them. They later found the horse at the hermitage of a sage. Sagara’s sons accused the innocent sage of stealing the horse, and that accusation brought about their ruin. Bhagirath, the great-great-grandson of Sagara, brought the Ganges down from heaven to earth in order to save his departed ancestors. </SPAN
